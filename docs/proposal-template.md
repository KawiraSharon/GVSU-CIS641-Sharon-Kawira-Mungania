# Anticipated Problems

Technologies I will be using- I am developing my coding skills and this is a given challenge but I will flex my muscle and learning to ensure the system meets my sponsor's needs.

Scalability and robustness of the system. As the full stack developer, I will have to ensure the software has very minimal downtime and is able to sustain many customers in its operability, most especially during work hours.

Rising competition - I have to ensure that the system updates are made and in adherance with any developing technologies to ensure better efficiency for its users.
