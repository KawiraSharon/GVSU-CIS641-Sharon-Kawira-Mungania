                        <li>
                            This system aims at solving the problem of unresponsive and complex interfaces often users experience in using their current banking systems. My objective is to create a system that reduces the frequency with which consumers must get in touch with customer service while doing daily routines. Users will be able to safely login in and out of the system, access their transaction history, check their balance, and transfer money amongst registered platform users. Join me in implementing and providing this solution to realize customer satisfaction.
